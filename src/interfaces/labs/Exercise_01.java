/**
 * Interfaces Exercise 1:
 *
 *      1) Write an interface with at least three methods. Write two classes that implement the
 *          interface in different ways.
 *      2) Write a class that extends one of the classes from the previous step. Overwrite the methods in
 *          the parent class.
